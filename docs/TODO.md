# TODO

> The project stucked with wrong umbrella structure
> Before we can continue we have to

  * Extract the _Repository_ to it's own OTP-App
  * Define a Protrocol for an _Adapter_ inside the _Repository_
  * Implement the protocol in _Issues_
  * Get the tests and frontend green again

â€“ good luck
